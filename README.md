# VybeDiscordBot
This is a discord bot that can respond to events/commands, as well as do things like playing music.  Events can be added under the events directory and commands under the commands directory. There are some sample commands and events in them already.

BE SURE TO CHANGE THE BOT TOKEN IN Main.js

If running into issues with the node modules, delete the folder, and then run the following command when in the directory in the command line:
npm install @discordjs/opus ffmpeg-static yt-search ytdl-core-discord

Please be aware that for the music playing portion of the bot to work, the computer running the bot must have ffmpeg installed
